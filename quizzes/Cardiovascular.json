      "question": "A 59-year-old male is admitted with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. ST elevation and T-wave inversion were seen on the ECG in V2, V3, and V4. IV thrombolytic therapy was started in the Emergency Department. Indications of successful reperfusion would include all of the following EXCEPT: ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) pain cessation.",
        "B": "(B) a decrease in CK or troponin.",
        "C": "(C) Reversal of ST segment elevation with a return to baseline.",
        "D": "(D) short runs of ventricular tachycardia."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) Coronary artery reperfusion (due to either PCI or fibrinolysis) results in an elevation of, NOT a decrease in, creatine kinase (CK) or tropon√≠n. The theory is that the return of blood flow distal to the occlusion can result in a \"reperfusion injury of muscle, elevating cardiac biomarkers. The other 3 choices are indicators of successful reperfusion."

      "question": "Which of the following mnedication orders should the nurse question for the patient described in question 1? (A 59-year-old male is admitted with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. ST elevation and T-wave inversion were seen on the ECG in V2, V3, and V4. IV thrombolytic therapy was started in the Emergency Department.) ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) metoprolol (Lopressor)",

        "C": "(C) propranolol (Inderal)",
        "D": "(D) heparin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) The patient in this scenario is having an acute anterior wall MI. A beta blocker is beneficial for an acute MI, as these agents decrease the work of the heart and increase the threshold for ventricular fibrillation. Although it is a beta-adrenergic blocker like metoprolol, propranolol is NOT a cardioselective beta blocker. It affects beta receptors in heart muscle AND lung tissue. Therefore, it is more likely to cause bronchoconstriction  than a cardioselective beta blocker. The other 3 choices (a cardioselective beta blocker, an antiplatelet, and an anticoagulant) are indicated for an acute MI, such as the one that the patient in this scenario is experiencing."

      "question": "If heart block develops while caring for the patient described in question 1, which of the following types would it most likely be? (A 59-year-old male is admitted with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. ST elevation and T-wave inversion were seen on the ECG in V2, V3, and V4. IV thrombolytic therapy was started in the Emergency Department.) ",
      "options": {

        "D": "(D) third-degree, complete"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) The patient is having an acute anterior MI, which is generally due to LAD occlusion. The LAD supplies the bundle of His, so an LAD occlusion could result in a second-degree Type II heart block. If symptomatic bradycardia were to occur, the patient may require transcutaneous pacing. The other 3 types of heart blocks are due to SA node or AV node ischemia, which generally occur with an RCA occlusion (inferior wall MI)."

      "question": "Appropriate drug therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy is aimed toward: ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) Decreasing contractility and decreasing both preload and afterload.",
        "B": "(B) Decreasing contractility and increasing both preload and afterload.",
        "C": "(C) Increasing contractility and increasing both preload and afterload.",
        "D": "(D) Increasing contractillity and decreasing both preload and afterload."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) Dilated cardiomyopathy is likely to result in systolic dysfunction, which decreases contractility, causes compensatory arterial constriction, and results in a higher left ventricular preload. To treat this, therapy is aimed at increasing contractility, decreasing afterload (arterial constriction), and decreasing preload that is too high."

        "D": "(D) calcium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) An abnormal level of sodium does NOT cause QT prolongation. In contrast, a low level of magnesium, potassium, or calcium may cause QT prolongation and may result in torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and, if self-limiting, a transient syncopal episode."

His neck veins are flat, the head of the bed is at 30 degrees, and his heart sounds are normal. His vital signs are as follows: BP is 78/48, heart rate is 124 beats/minute, and respiratory rate is 26 breaths/minute. What should the nurse suspect? ",

        "D": "(D) acute closure of the stented coronary artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) Retroperitoneal bleeding may cause signs of hypovolemia and hypovolemic shock, as described in this scenario. It may be a complication of a PCI if the femoral artery is the access site during the procedure. Only this problem results in severe back pain; none of the other 3 choices results in back pain."

        "D": "(D) The patient has developed an acute ventricular septal defect."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) The location of the murmur, at the apex of the heart (midclavicular, 5th ICS), is one clue to this answer. In addition, regurgitation occurs when the valve should be closed, and the mitral valve should be closed during systole. Mitral valve stenosis, choice (C), occurs when the mitral valve is open. Additionally, mitral valve stenosis cannot be acute; it develops gradually."

      "options": {
        "A": "(A) both the atrium and ventricle are paced and sensed and may either inhibit or pace in response to sensing.",
        "B": "(B) the ventricle is paced, ventricular activity is sensed, and pacing is inhibited in response to ventricular sensing.",
        "C": "(C) both the atrium and ventricle are paced, but only ventricular pacing can be inhibited by a sensed intrinsic ventricular impulse.",

      "question": " A patient complains of sudden dyspnea 5 days S/P an acute MI (ST elevation in II, III, and aVF with ST depression in I and aVL). The patient is anxious, diaphoretic, and hypotensive. An examination reveals the development of a loud holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiates to the axilla. The patient has crackles throughout but no S3 heart sound at the apex. What is the most likely cause of this patient's deterioration? ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) right ventricular failure related to a right ventricular MI",
        "B": "(B) ventricular septal defect",
        "C": "(C) left ventricular failure due to extension of the MI",
        "D": "(D) acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture or dysfunctions"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) The scenario describes a patient having an acute inferior wall MI, which is generally due to occlusion of the RCA. The RCA occlusion may result in papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture of the mitral valve because it supplies the area of the left ventricle where this valve is attached. Although RV infarct could result in RCA occlusion, RV infarct does not result in a holosystolic murmur at the apex of the heart or lung crackles."

      "question": " A patient with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock now requires high dose dopamine (greater than 10 mcg/kg/min) to maintain her blood pressure, and the cardiologist is planning to start IABP therapy. This therapy will benefit the patient because it will: ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) Increase afterload with balloon inflation and decrease diastolic augmentation with balloon deflation.",
        "B": "(B) Decrease afterload with balloon deflation and increase diastolic augmentation with balloon inflation.",

        "D": "(D) Increase afterload with balloon deflation and decrease diastolic augmentation with balloon inflation."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) Cadiogenic shock results in a decrease in cardiac output with a resultant drop in coronary artery perfusion and compensatory vasoconstriction. The deflation of the balloon that is placed into the descending aorta is beneficial. Deflation decreases afterload and work of the left ventricle. Inflation of the balloon is beneficial because it \"boluses\" blood into the coronary arteries, increasing perfusion."

        "D": "(D) Ask the patient to bear down as if having a bowel movement."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) The patient's response to the arrthythmia will determine whether treatment needs to be emergent and what the treatment will be. Vagal maneuvers (e.g. bearing down) are not known to be effective for atrial fibrillation."

        "C": "(C) dopamine",
        "D": "(D) dobutamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, there is a problem with filling. A decrease in heart rate provided by a beta blocker such as metoprolol would increase the filling time. Diastolic dysfunction does NOT cause a problem with ejection, and the EF is normal. The other 3 choices may be indicated for systolic dysfunction."

        "D": "(D) acute reinfarction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) This scenario describes an acute anterior SIEMI generally eaused by an occlusion of the LAD. This type of MI is most likely to result in a VSD. Addilonally, the location of the murmur is important. Mitral valve disease-telated problems do NOT cause murmurs to be loudest at the left sternal border, whereas a VSD would result in a murmur at this location."

        "D": "(D) aggessive fluid administration and a right-sided ECG."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) This scenario describes a patient having an acute inferor STEMI, gernerally due to RCA occlusion. An RCA occlusion may result in an RV infarct, which this patient has signs of (hypotension with clear lungs). The definitive treatment is emergent PCI. Fluid administration will help increase coronary artery perfusion by correcting hypotension and ensure adequate RV preload. A right-sided ECG may help confirm the RV infarct. Nitroglycerin, diuretics, and morphine may decrease preload, which would worsen the hypotension."

      "explanation": "(B) Pulsus paradoxus is fluctuation of the systolic blood pressure with inspiration and expiration by more than 12 mmHg, best seen when an arterial line is in place. Inspiration increases thoracic pressure. When combined with fluid surrounding the heart in cardiac tamponade, inspiration further decreases venous return to the heart, leading to a drop in systolic pressure by > 12 mmHg during the inspiratory phase of breathing. Pulsus alternans (choice (A)) is characterized by a change in amplitude of the systolic wavelorm from beat to beat, usually indicative of severe left ventricular failure.

        "D": "(D) antiarrhythmics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) This scenario describes the development of atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and a stable BP. Even with a normal BP, the development of atrial fibrillation drops the cardiac output by 20% to 25% due to a loss in \"atrial kick\" provided by a normal sinus rhythm. A cardiac glycoside (such as digoxin) may be beneficial since it is a weak positive inotrope that may compensate for the loss of atrial kick, and calcium channel blockers will keep the heart rate controlled. Pressors are not needed in this case. The use of both beta blockers and calcium channel blockers would decrease the heart rate too much. ACE inhibitors would offer no benefit in this case."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) The patient's clinical status describes a stable BP but the development of a bradyarrhythmia, specifically a complete heart block with a ventricular rate of 30 beats/ minute. This is usually seen with RCA disease, generally associated with an inferior MI. A patient assessment will determine treatment. Transcutaneous pacing would be an appropriate treatment for an unstable patient with this arrhythmia."

The patient is currently connected to the bedside monitor with a nasal cannula at 2 L/minute in place and intravenous fluids (0.9% NS) being administered at a rate of 10 mL/hour. Which of the following sequences of interventions would be the most appropriate for the nurse to follow at this time? ",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) This clinical description may be that of acute coronary syndrome complicated by hypotension. Addressing the hypotension is a priority since this is further decreasing coronary artery perfusion. A fluid bolus would address the hypotension, and no contraindications seem to be present for a fluid bolus since the lungs are clear. Aspirin is indicated for acute chest pain and could be given while preparing to do the ECG, which is needed to help make the diagnosis."

      "options": {
        "A": "(A) An anterior MI is often associated with heart blocks or bradyarrhythmias.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) Since most inferior MIs are due to RCA occlusion and the RCA also supplies blood to the right ventricular muscle wall, an inferior MI is associated with RV infarct."
