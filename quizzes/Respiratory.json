      "question": "Which of the following developments would indicate that a patient, who is receiving noninvasive ventilation, may require intubation with an endotracheal tube? ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) a need for an increase in FiO2 from 0.30 to 0.40",
        "B": "(B) a dry cough and a fever",
        "C": "(C) a change in mental status with difficulty to arouse",
        "D": "(D) positive blood cultures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) Noninvasive ventilation is not safe for a patient who is unable to protect his or her airway. A depressed level of consciousness increases the risk of airway obstruction or aspiration. Choice (A) can be provided with NIV, Choices (B) and (D) do not put a patient who is receiving NIV at a greater risk for a poor outcome."

      "question": " A patient was discharged from the medical unit 7 days ago following an acute ischemic stroke and is now anxious and complaining of severe shortness of breath. The patient demonstrates tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, an SpO2 of 88% on 3L/nasal cannula, and a temperature of 37.9°C. Breath sounds are present, clear, and equal bilaterally. A chest X-ray is clear. ABGs reveal respiratory alkalosis. Based on this history and assessment, which of the following problems exists and which interventions should the nurse anticipate? ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) increased dead space ventilation; fibrinolytic therapy",
        "B": "(B) decreased dynamic compliance; bronchodilators",
        "C": "(C) infection; antibiotics",
        "D": "(D) shunt; PEEP therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) This scenario describes a patient who is experiencing a pulmonary embolism (PE). Signs of hypotension and hypoxemia indicate that it is a massive PE. The PE increases dead space ventilation due to the drop in pulmonary perfusion. Fibrinolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator) is indicated for a massive PE, For any of the other choices to be correct, the patient would have to have abnormal breath sounds."

      "options": {
        "A": "(A) Increase the FiO2.",
        "B": "(B) Administer mnorphine.",
        "C": "(C) Obtain stat ABGS",
        "D": "(D) Administer a bronchodilator."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) This clinical picture is one of asthma. Asthma is an airway problem that results in bronchospasm, which increases airway pressure as evidenced by an elevated inspiratory pressure while the lung pressure itself (the plateau pressure) remains normal. Symptoms would be relieved with a bronchodilator. The other choices would not relieve these symptoms."

        "A": "(A) Decrease the peak flow rate.",
        "B": "(B) Increase the tidal volume.",
        "C": "(C) Check for auto-PEEP",
        "D": "(D) Increase the breath rate."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) A patient with asthma has difficulty with expiration. Therefore, with each breath air may get trapped, resulting in elevation of the end-expiratory pressure without PEEP being set on the ventilator. This may decrease cardiac output because it decreases venous return. The other interventions would all increase the air trapping."

        "D": "(D) Deflate the endotracheal tube cuff prior to suctioning."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) Mouth care decreases bacterial colonization in the mouth, which decreases the possibility of microaspiration of bacteria in lower airways. The other 3 choices have NOT been found to decrease incidences of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sedation should be minimized. The head of the bed should be greater than 30°, The ETT cuff should not be deflated prior to suctioning but, instead, prior to ETT removal. (At that time, the mouth and the subglottic space should be well suctioned.)"

      "question": "A 49-year-old male, who weighs 70 kg. is admited to the 1CU with smoke inhalation and ARDS. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with the following ventilator settings: FiO2: 0.80, assist-control mode 10 breaths/minute, Vt 400 ml, and PEEP 15 cm of pressure. Arterial blood gases are as follows. pH 7.39, PaCO2 42, PaO2 96, HCO3 22, and O2 sat 98%. Which of the following interventions is appropriate? ",

        "C": "(C) Decrease the PEEP.",
        "D": "(D) Do not make any changes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) The goal is to get the FiO2 down to 50% or less ASAP for a patient who requires high FiO2. This patient's oxygenation status would allow for a decrease in the FiO2. During acute ARDS, the tidal volume needs to be low to prevent volutrauma, and the PEEP needs to be maintained to limit atelectasis."

        "D": "(D) The plateau pressure is used to calculate dynamic compliance."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) Decreased compliance increases \"stiffness\" and therefore requires more work to ventilate. Choice (A) is not correct because an increase in the peak inspiratory pressure will decrease dynamic compliance. Choice (C) is not correct because asthma decreases dynamic (airway) compliance, not static (lung) compliance. Choice (D) is not correct because dynamic compliance is calculated using the peak inspiratory pressure."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) If the PAOP is high, the pulmonary edema is most likely cardiac in origin, whereas in ARDS, the pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic in origin. The other 3 choices (bilateral infiltrates, refractory hypoxemia, and tachypnea) are all present in ARDS."

        "D": "(D) Maintain the patient in a supine position."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(C) This clinical scenario is one of right-sided pneumonia. Therefore, the right side is the \"bad\" side. Due to the effects of gravity on perfusion, the patient generally does better with the \"good\" lung DOWN, With the \"bad\" lung down, there is an increased risk of worsening hypoxemia. Choice (A) is not correct because the patient is not wheezing. Therefore, there is no indication for a bronchodilator. Choice (B) is not correct because this condition does not warrant NIV. Choice (D) is not correct because the best position for a patient with a pulmonary problem is sitting upright, not lying flat."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) A patient with asthma needs a bronchodilator (to treat the bronchospasm caused by smooth muscle contraction around the airways) and steroids (to treat the airway inflammation). There is no indication for anticoagulants, diuretics, or antibiotics to treat asthma."

        "D": "(D) increasing the ventilator breath rate."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(D) An increase in the ventilator breath rate will influence the PaCO2 (ventilation), not oxygenation. The other 3 choices will improve oxygenation at the tissue level. An increase in the FiO2 will provide more oxygen at the alveolar-capillary membrane. A blood transfusion will increase oxygen content by increasing hemoglobin, which is the carrier of oxygen. Increasing a low blood pressure will increase oxygen delivery."

      "question": " While monitoring a patient post-thoracotomy, the nurse suspects that there is hypoventilation. Which characteristic best detines hypoventilation? ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) PaC02 > 45 mmHg",
        "B": "(B) respiratory rate < 12",
        "C": "(C) pH < 7.35",
        "D": "(D) PaO2 < 60 mmHg"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(A) The best clinical indicator of effective ventilation is the PaCO2. Although a breath rate less than 12 may indicate hypoventilation, it is not as sensitive an indicator as is PaCO2. In addition, the breath rate does not include the other determinant of effective ventilation (depth of ventilation or tidal volume). Although a low pH may indicate hypoventilation, it may also indicate metabolic acidosis. Hypoxemia (PaO2 less than 80 mmHg on room air) may be present during hyperventilation."

      "question": " Apatient who was admitted with a carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level of 45% is lethargic and complains of a headache. The patient is recelving 100% O2 per a face mask and is noted to have an SpO2 of 100%, Which of the following is indicated? ",
      "options": {
        "A": "(A) Administer hydrocodone with acetaminophen.",
        "B": "(B) Continue the FiO2 of 1.00,",
        "C": "(C) Decrease the FiO2.",
        "D": "(D) Intubate and initiate mechanical ventilation."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) If the patient has a COHb level of 45%, the best SaO2 achievable is 55% since saturation of hemoglobin cannot be greater than 100% total. The patient needs 100% Fi02 until COHb levels have returned to normal and symptoms (alteration in the level of consciousness and headaches) are relieved. Opiates may depress the level of consciousness and mask the patient's response to FiO2. A decrease in the FiO2 would decrease the driving forces of oxygen and prolong abnormal COHb levels. Intubation would not help oxygenation since the same FiO2 can be provided with a face mask. Intubation would be indicated for a ventilation problem, but the patient does not have signs of hypoventilation."

      "explanation": "(C) This clinical scenario describes a pneumothorax. As a result of hypotension and tracheal deviation to the opposite side of the pneumothorax, the pneumothorax is a life-threatening tension pneumothorax with symptoms that are the result of a mediastinal shift. If ARDS was the problem, the patient would have bilateral crackles. If a hemothorax was the problem, there would generally be a history of trauma, not an infection. A mediastinal shift (tracheal deviation to the opposite side and hypotension) is not usually present witha hemothorax. If the problem was a PE, the breath sounds would be equal bilaterally."

      "explanation": "(B) Since the patient has ARDS, low tidal volumes (5-6 mL/kg) are indicated (permissive hypercapnia) in order to prevent volutrauma. Since the patient weighs 70 kg, a Vt of 700 mL is too high. CPAP requires that the patient has a spontaneous breathing effort. Therefore, CPAP is not appropriate for this patient. A patient with ARDS requires high PEEP to prevent atelectasis and hypoxemia. Therefore, a decrease in PEEP would worsen the hypoxemia. The plateau pressure should be kept at 30 cm H2O or less.

      "explanation": "(B) Due to the patient's decreased level of consciousness, the need for improved ventilation is a priority. NIV would address the hypoventilation, but it would not be considered safe for a patient with minimal responsiveness.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) This clinical scenario is one of a pulmonary embolism. With the history of long bone fractures and the development of petechiae, a fat embolism is most likely. ARDS does not present with clear lungs. DVT does not always result in a PE. If it did, though, the PE would be due to a blood clot and petechiae would not be present. Delirium may result in agitation but not the other symptoms."

      "question": " A patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) is as follows: pH 7.32, PaCO2 33, and HCO3 16. Based on this ABG, what might be this patient's problem? ",

        "D": "(D) electrolyte imbalance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(B) The low pH indicates acidosis. The low bicarbonate indicates that the acidosis is metabolic, and the low PaC02 indicates that hyperventilation has started in order to compensate. The only option that causes metabolic acidosis is shock. Anxiety generally causes respiratory alkalosis. An opiate drug overdose results in respiratory acidosis. An electrolyte imbalance (low chloride) causes metabolic alkalosis."
