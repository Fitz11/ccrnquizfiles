(A) tachycardia and trembling     <-- each question is identified by (X). Currently only supports 4 option questions A-D (no more, no less)
(B) bradycardia and diaphoresis
(C) anxiety and flushed, dry skin
(D) flushed, dry skin and tachycardia
                                                                        <-- all questions must be separated by a blank line, identified by RegExp(r'\r?\n\r?\n')
2. Which of the following is TRUE for a patient who has had a right-sided stroke
and develops increased intracranial pressure?
(A) The pupils will change before the level of consciousness does, there will be right-sided
paralysis, the eyes will be deviated to the left, and there will be a left pupil change.
(B) The pupils will change before the level of consciousness does, there will be left-sided
(C) The level of consciousness will change before there will be pupil changes, there
paralysis, the eyes will be deviated to the right, and there will be a right pupil change.
will be right-sided paralysis, the eyes will be deviated to the left, and there will be
a left pupil change.
(D) The level of consciousness will change before there will be pupil changes, there will be left-sided paralysis, the eyes will be deviated to the right, and there will be
a right pupil change.

1. (A) When the blood glucose drops, sympathetic stimulation occurs. (Symptoms are
masked for a patient who is receiving beta-adrenergic blocker drugs.) Flushed, dry skin
is a sign of hyperglycemia.

2. (D) Higher brain centers (cerebral cortex) are the first to be affected by increased intracranial 
pressure. Therefore, the level of consciousness is the first sign (the one exception 
to that rule is epidural hematoma). Pupil changes are ipsilateral (same side as the
injury) due to compression of cranial nerve II against the transtentorial notch. Motor
changes are contralateral (opposite side of the injury) due to motor fiber crossing in
the brain stem.
